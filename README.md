# GitSuperStars

A small project that consist on load the best rated swift repositories from GitHub to test some implementations in swift as: 

  - Infinite scrolling with UITableView
  - MVVM + Coordinators
  - View Coding
  - RxSwift
  - Modular Development Architecture

The idea with the modular development is to improve the build time for bigger projects, and having a `Core` pr√© built module, with the base architecture, resources, and protected sensitive business information from the third party developers responsible to develop `Features`.
